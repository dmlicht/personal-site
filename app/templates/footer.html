<footer><p>This is a site built in HTML5, CSS3, Python, and Flask. It uses <a href='http://www.google.com/fonts/#ChoosePlace:select/Collection:Droid+Sans|Lato'>Google Web Fonts</a>, <a href="#">Subtle Patterns</a> and <a href="#">a noun from the noun project</a>. If you would like a custom site built, designed, or both contact dlichte5 [at] jhu [dot] edu. I would be excited to get involved in pro bono projects if they are not too long and for a good cause :D<p></footer>
